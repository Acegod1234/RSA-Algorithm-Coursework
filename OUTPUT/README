In first screenshot of output, we can see that the entered number is not a prime number thus it shows "WRONG INPUT".
Similarly, in second screenshot, we can see that the enetred number in secons pop-up is also a composite number thus again showing "WRONG INPUT" message.
The program will not continue any futther if the "WRONG INPUT" message is shown.
In the last screenshot, prime numbers are entered in both pop-ups and so the program runs.
The message was enetred, it was encrypted and also decrypted with th help of provate key.
